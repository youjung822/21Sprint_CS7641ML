# Assignment 2 - Randomized Optimization
This readme is to guide how to reproduce experiment results for Assignment 2.
Assignment 2 is consist of two main parts:
Experiment 1. To run four optimization algorithms against the Knapsack problem, the Continuous Peaks problem, and the flip-flop problem.
Experiment 2 To run neural network models using randomized optimization algorithms. 

## Running Experiment 1
Repository: https://github.com/youjung822/21Sprint_CS7641ML/tree/main/assignment2

To run the experiment to run 4 randomized optimization algorithms against 3 problem sets, enter `python run_all_experiments` on your command. All output products will be generated by this script.
Individual experiments can be re-run by running:

`python flipflop.py`
`python knapsack.py`
`python cpeaks.py`

Plots can be regenerated for their respective components of the experiments by running:
`python plot_toy_results.py`

## Running Experiment 2
Data: https://github.com/youjung822/data/raw/main/train.csv
Code: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1J-UwLudCuIBkEcU1GV5hhIpR_ObK_GeS#scrollTo=q0BD1Wbab7U

Run cells in the google colab will reproduce the result.
