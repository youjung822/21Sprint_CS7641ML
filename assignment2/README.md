# Assignment 2 - Randomized Optimization
This readme is to guide how to reproduce experiment results for Assignment 2.
Assignment 2 is consist of two main parts:
Experiment 1. To run four optimization algorithms against the Knapsack problem, the Continuous Peaks problem, and the flip-flop problem.
Experiment 2 To run neural network models using randomized optimization algorithms. 

## Running Experiment 1
To run the experiment forin sequence, run `python run_all_experiments`. All output products will be generated by this script.
Individual experiments can be re-run by running:

`python flipflop.py`
`python knapsack.py`
`python cpeaks.py`
`python neuralnet.py`.

Plots can be regenerated for their respective components of the experiments by running:
`python plot_nn_results.py`
`python plot_toy_results.py`
